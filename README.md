# Running P1

Use the following command, adding in what driver file to run:
* The run.sh script will compile the modeltoworld with the ejml library in the classpath
  * It will then run the Modeltoworld main with the given driverfile
* Before running the script it will rm all class files in the current directory and recompile
  * *I did this because sometimes the library wouldn't load properly, to run several driver files more effeciently comment out that line*

`
  ./run.sh 'driverfile.txt'
`

**Important Notes**

1. The output object files will not contain vertex normals or the s factor (to match the output given in the test cases), this is just a commented out line in the code.
2. The models must live in a directory called "models" in the same working directory as the Modeltoworld.java, otherwise the program won't find them
3. If the run.sh script isn't working, you should be able to compile with these commands:

`
# Clean out class files in the current dir
rm *.class
# Remove the org dir and rebuild the libaries
rm -rf ./org
jar -xvf EJML.jar
# Compile with the libraries in the classpath
javac -cp "./org/ejml/*:." Modeltoworld.java
# Run the program
java Modeltoworld 'driverfile.txt'
`
